This am project was created before my Natualization Test. It too me about 2-3 hours.
The goal is to test all 100 questions, and save the ones I am not sure about the answer, then review again until I know all the answer.
I used this tool for a week, and pass the test with confidence.
Next step, I will try to recreate the app again with Vue.js and possibly other JavaScript frameworks.
